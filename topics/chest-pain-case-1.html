      <div class="spoken">
        <span class="label">SPOKEN</span>

        <h3>Phase 1 - Introduction and Consent</h3>
        <p>Hello, I am Dr Ushana.</p>
        <p>How would you like me to address you?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Call me Peter.”</p>
        <p>Thank you Peter. I understand you are experiencing chest pain. I will ask some focused questions to understand what is happening and then explain what I think and what we need to do next. Is that okay?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Yes.”</p>

        <h3>Phase 2 - Open Question</h3>
        <p>Can you tell me what happened today?</p>
        <p>Patient: “I developed chest pain about an hour ago.”</p>

        <h3>Phase 3 - Focused History</h3>
        <p>When exactly did the pain begin?</p>
        <p>Patient: “About an hour ago.”</p>

        <p>Was it sudden or gradual?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Sudden.”</p>

        <p>Where do you feel it?</p>
        <p>Patient: “In the middle of my chest.”</p>

        <p>How would you describe it?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Like pressure.”</p>

        <p>Does it go anywhere?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Into my left arm.”</p>

        <p>How severe is it from zero to ten?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Eight.”</p>

        <p>Any sweating or nausea?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Yes, sweating.”</p>

        <p>Any shortness of breath?</p>
        <p>Patient: “A little.”</p>

        <p>Any fainting?</p>
        <p>Patient: “No.”</p>

        <p>Any tearing pain going to your back?</p>
        <p>Patient: “No.”</p>

        <p>Any recent long travel or leg swelling?</p>
        <p>Patient: “No.”</p>

        <p>Have you ever had this before?</p>
        <p>Patient: “No.”</p>

        <p>Are you allergic to aspirin?</p>
        <p>Patient: “No.”</p>

        <p>Have you taken any erectile dysfunction medication in the last 48 hours?</p>
        <p>Patient: “No.”</p>

        <h3>Phase 4 - Red Flag Sweep</h3>
        <p>Just to confirm, no severe sudden tearing back pain, no collapse, and no confusion. Correct?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Correct.”</p>

        <h3>Phase 5 - Structured Summary</h3>
        <p>Let me summarise to ensure I understood correctly.</p>
        <p>You developed sudden central chest pressure one hour ago, radiating to your left arm, associated with sweating and mild breathlessness. You have hypertension, high cholesterol, and you smoke. The pain is still present. Is that accurate?</p>
        <p>Patient: “Yes.”</p>

        <h3>Phase 6 - Diagnosis Explanation</h3>
        <p>Based on what you have told me, the most likely diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome, meaning reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.</p>

        <div class="scoring">
          <span class="label">SCORING PHRASE</span>
          <div>Sudden central chest pressure with radiation and autonomic symptoms must be treated as acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise.</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Phase 7 - Differential Explanation</h3>
        <p>Other serious causes we must consider include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs.</li>
          <li>Aortic dissection, which is a tear in the main artery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, your symptom pattern strongly suggests a cardiac cause.</p>

        <h3>Phase 8 - Management Plan</h3>
        <p>We are in a GP setting.</p>

        <div class="focus">
          <strong>FOCUS HERE</strong>
          <div>This requires urgent escalation.</div>
        </div>

        <p>The first step is to perform an ECG immediately.</p>

        <div class="scoring">
          <span class="label">SCORING PHRASE</span>
          <div>ECG must be done immediately in suspected acute coronary syndrome.</div>
        </div>

        <p>I will give aspirin now since you have no allergy.</p>
        <p>Because this may be a heart attack, you require immediate ambulance transfer to hospital.</p>
        <p>We will not delay transfer for blood tests such as troponin, as those are performed in hospital.</p>
        <p>I will only provide oxygen if your oxygen level is low or you develop respiratory distress.</p>

        <h3>Phase 9 - Urgency Classification</h3>
        <p>This is an emergency and requires immediate hospital transfer.</p>

        <h3>Phase 10 - Safety Net</h3>
        <p>If your pain worsens, you feel faint, or breathing becomes difficult while waiting, emergency services are already being called and we will act immediately.</p>

        <h3>Phase 11 - Check Understanding</h3>
        <p>Do you have any questions before we arrange the ambulance?</p>
        <p>Patient: “No.”</p>
