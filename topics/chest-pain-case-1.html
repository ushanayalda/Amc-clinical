    <h2>SECTION 3 – SPOKEN SCRIPT</h2>

    <div class="spoken">
      <h3>PHASE 1 – Introduction and Consent</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Hello, I am Dr Ushana.</div>
      <div class="line doctor">How would you like me to address you?</div>

      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Call me Sara.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Thank you Sara. I understand you have sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. I will ask some focused questions and then explain what I think and what we need to do next. Is that okay?</div>

      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 2 – Open Question</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Can you tell me what happened today?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “I suddenly felt sharp pain in my chest and it hurts to breathe.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 3 – Focused History</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">When did it begin?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “About three hours ago.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Was it sudden?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Where exactly is the pain?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Right side.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Is it worse when you breathe in?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any coughing up blood?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any fainting?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any swelling or pain in your legs?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “My left calf feels sore.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Have you travelled recently?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes, long flight four days ago.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Are you on the oral contraceptive pill?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any severe tearing pain to your back?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any heavy sweating or radiation to your arm or jaw?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Are you allergic to any medications?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 4 – Red Flag Sweep</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Just to confirm, no collapse, no severe sudden tearing back pain, and no confusion. Correct?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Correct.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 5 – Structured Summary</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Let me summarise to ensure I understood correctly.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">You developed sudden sharp right-sided chest pain three hours ago, worse with breathing, associated with shortness of breath. You recently travelled long-haul, are on the oral contraceptive pill, and have some calf discomfort. Is that accurate?</div>

      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 6 – Diagnosis Explanation</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Based on what you have told me, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lungs.</div>

      <div class="scoring">
        <span class="label">SCORING PHRASE</span>
        Sudden pleuritic chest pain with shortness of breath and risk factors must be treated as pulmonary embolism until proven otherwise.
      </div>

      <h3>PHASE 7 – Differential Explanation</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Other possibilities include:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Pneumothorax</li>
        <li>Acute coronary syndrome</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="line doctor">However, your risk factors strongly support pulmonary embolism.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 8 – Management Plan</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">We are in a GP setting.</div>

      <div class="focus"><strong>FOCUS HERE</strong><br>This cannot be safely investigated here.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">You require urgent hospital assessment immediately.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">I will arrange ambulance transfer now.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">We will not delay transfer for blood tests in clinic.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Oxygen will be provided only if your oxygen level is low or you develop respiratory distress.</div>

      <div class="scoring">
        <span class="label">SCORING PHRASE</span>
        Suspected pulmonary embolism in GP requires urgent hospital referral without delay.
      </div>

      <div class="line doctor">Before any blood thinners are started in hospital, contraindications such as bleeding risk will be assessed.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 9 – Urgency Classification</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">This is an emergency and requires immediate hospital transfer.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 10 – Safety Net</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">If your breathing worsens or you feel faint while waiting, emergency services are already being arranged and we will act immediately.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 11 – Check Understanding</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Do you have any questions before we arrange the ambulance?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>
    </div>
