    <h2>SECTION 3 – SPOKEN SCRIPT</h2>

    <div class="spoken">

      <h3>PHASE 1 – Introduction and Consent</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Hello, I am Dr Ushana.</div>
      <div class="line doctor">How would you like me to address you?</div>

      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Call me Mr Lewis.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Thank you Mr Lewis. I understand you have chest pain. I will ask focused questions and then explain what I think and what we need to do next. Is that okay?</div>

      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 2 – Open Question</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Can you tell me what happened today?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “I developed pressure in my chest about 40 minutes ago.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 3 – Focused History</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Was it sudden?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Where exactly is the pain?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “In the centre.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Does it spread anywhere?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “To my left arm.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any sweating or nausea?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any shortness of breath?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any tearing pain to your back?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Any recent long travel?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Are you allergic to aspirin?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “No.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Have you taken any medication for erectile dysfunction recently?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes, last night.”</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Thank you for telling me. That is important.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 4 – Red Flag Sweep</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Just to confirm, no collapse and no severe tearing back pain. Correct?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Correct.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 5 – Structured Summary</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Let me summarise to ensure I understood correctly.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">You developed sudden central chest pressure 40 minutes ago, radiating to your arm, associated with sweating and shortness of breath. You have hypertension and took sildenafil last night. Is that accurate?</div>

      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

      <h3>PHASE 6 – Diagnosis Explanation</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Based on what you have described, the most likely diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome.</div>

      <div class="scoring">
        <span class="label">SCORING PHRASE</span>
        Sudden central chest pressure with autonomic symptoms must be treated as acute coronary syndrome until proven otherwise.
      </div>

      <h3>PHASE 7 – Differential Explanation</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Other possibilities include pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection, but your symptom pattern strongly suggests a cardiac cause.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 8 – Management Plan</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">We are in a GP setting.</div>

      <div class="focus"><strong>FOCUS HERE</strong><br>This is an emergency.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">The first step is to perform an ECG immediately.</div>

      <div class="scoring">
        <span class="label">SCORING PHRASE</span>
        ECG must be done immediately in suspected acute coronary syndrome.
      </div>

      <div class="line doctor">I will give aspirin now since you have no allergy.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">However, because you took sildenafil recently, I will not give nitrates.</div>

      <div class="scoring">
        <span class="label">SCORING PHRASE</span>
        Nitrates are contraindicated in patients who have recently taken sildenafil due to risk of severe hypotension.
      </div>

      <div class="line doctor">You require immediate ambulance transfer to hospital.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">We will not delay transfer for investigations that must be done in hospital.</div>

      <div class="line doctor">Oxygen will only be given if your oxygen level is low or you develop respiratory distress.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 9 – Urgency Classification</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">This is an emergency requiring immediate hospital transfer.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 10 – Safety Net</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">If your pain worsens or you feel faint while waiting, emergency services are being arranged and we will act immediately.</div>

      <h3>PHASE 11 – Check Understanding</h3>

      <div class="line doctor">Do you understand why we must avoid certain medications and transfer urgently?</div>
      <div class="line patient"><span class="who">Patient:</span> “Yes.”</div>

    </div>

    <h2>SECTION 6 – MASTERY DRILL</h2>

    <div class="thinking">
      <strong>30-Second Compression</strong><br>
      Central chest pressure with radiation and autonomic symptoms in a high-risk patient. Most likely acute coronary syndrome. Recent sildenafil means no nitrates. ECG now and immediate ambulance transfer.
    </div>

    <div class="thinking">
      <strong>10-Second Trigger Rule</strong><br>
      Chest pain plus PDE5 use equals no nitrates.
    </div>

    <div class="thinking">
      <strong>Differential Ranking</strong><br>
      1) Acute coronary syndrome<br>
      2) Pulmonary embolism<br>
      3) Aortic dissection
    </div>

    <div class="thinking">
      <strong>Why Not Pulmonary Embolism?</strong><br>
      Symptom pattern is central pressure with radiation and autonomic symptoms rather than pleuritic pain.
    </div>

    <div class="thinking">
      <strong>First Action Rule</strong><br>
      ECG immediately and arrange ambulance transfer. Avoid nitrates due to sildenafil.
